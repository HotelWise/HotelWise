appearance this place seemed nice but the 3 cars with broken windows in the parking lot should hv told me something. 😒\\n\\nAs the attendant was taking me to my room she seemed surprised to find the room nxt to mine was kicked in and left open & disheveled. You could see several large kick marks on the bright white dr. Dare I say another RED flag.\\n\\nThe hotel has 2 sides - one half seemed to be remodeled with new paint & carpet in the halls and newly renovated rooms. But there are no shower curtains as we were told we had to provide our own as well as sheets & towels (this is now provided with the new ownership - the hotel was sold agn during my short stay)\\n\\nThere is a laundry but it has business hours (really?) And to use it you need to get change from the desk - only thing is they hv no change nor do they hv a change machine!!!\\n\\nThe new owners came in & immediately hiked up the rates - double the amount daily (from $40+ to $70+) for a rm with roaches - albeit remodeled but still with roaches.\\n\\nThere is a hole in the wall that is connected to the balcony - so the inside is outside at all times.\\n\\nThe other half of the hotel is uninhabitable & seems dangerous and the new weekly rates are $310 did i mention you get a flat scrn, cable, a sml fridge & a sml microwave for all of this 👍 Smh....\\n\\nThere is a pool & hot tub that used to be turquoise blue but is now bad shade of brown.\\n\\nAs the new owners show up in their luxury Maserati each day...   \n","6

I've been staying here for nearly 2 months so far and would reccomend this place. This place is huge! It is a former Ramada hotel that went out of business sometime last year and whoever bought it decided to turn it into a short term apartment building/week to week hotel. They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months. Would recommend staying here overall!!   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Just checked in and found out that it is under new ownership.

I've been staying here for nearly 2 months so far and would reccomend this place. This place is huge! It is a former Ramada hotel that went out of business sometime last year and whoever bought it decided to turn it into a short term apartment building/week to week hotel. They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months. Would recommend staying here overall!!</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Just checked in and found out that it is under new ownership.
