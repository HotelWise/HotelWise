They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months.

I've been staying here for nearly 2 months so far and would reccomend this place. This place is huge! It is a former Ramada hotel that went out of business sometime last year and whoever bought it decided to turn it into a short term apartment building/week to week hotel. They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months. Would recommend staying here overall!!   \n","1  This was previously a Ramada but was sold & became the Palms Inn.\\n\\nOn 1st appearance this place seemed nice but the 3 cars with broken windows in the parking lot should hv told me something. 😒\\n\\nAs the attendant was taking me to my room she seemed surprised to find the room nxt to mine was kicked in and left open & disheveled.
