I've been staying here for nearly 2 months so far and would reccomend this place. This place is huge! It is a former Ramada hotel that went out of business sometime last year and whoever bought it decided to turn it into a short term apartment building/week to week hotel. They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months. Would recommend staying here overall!!",['pool']

On 1st appearance this place seemed nice but the 3 cars with broken windows in the parking lot should hv told me something. üòí

As the attendant was taking me to my room she seemed surprised to find the room nxt to mine was kicked in and left open & disheveled. You could see several large kick marks on the bright white dr. Dare I say another RED flag.

The hotel has 2 sides - one half seemed to be remodeled with new paint & carpet in the halls and newly renovated rooms. But there are no shower curtains as we were told we had to provide our own as well as sheets & towels (this is now provided with the new ownership - the hotel was sold agn during my short stay)

There is a laundry but it has business hours (really?) And to use it you need to get change from the desk - only thing is they hv no change nor do they hv a change machine!!!

The new owners came in & immediately hiked up the rates - double the amount daily (from $40+ to $70+) for a rm with roaches - albeit remodeled but still with roaches.

There is a hole in the wall that is connected to the balcony - so the inside is outside at all times.

The other half of the hotel is uninhabitable & seems dangerous and the new weekly rates are $310 did i mention you get a flat scrn, cable, a sml fridge & a sml microwave for all of this üëç Smh....

There is a pool & hot tub that used to be turquoise blue but is now bad shade of brown.

As the new owners show up in their luxury Maserati each day...","['laundry', 'pool', 'parking lot', 'parking']"

Nothing on the internet said anything about a parking garage and clearance issues nor extra charges. I didn't see any - my bad if there was! We booked 2 rooms - they did put us side by side - Rooms 312 & 314

There is a refrigerator in the room, but would you like rust with it? Ours was rusted so bad the door was barely hanging on. It was still working- bought a 6 pack of cokes and they were frozen solid by the morning. Wow!

Beds and bathroom were OK - just had to call down to have towels delivered- that was a joke! We had 3 people in each room and they left one towel and one bath mat each day. No wash cloths! The front desk person said ""Yes, we have towels here, but you have to come get them- wash cloths were not available- they were all taken.""

Front desk people were very rude no matter if it was first thing in the morning, 4pm or midnight. Birds were flying around in lobby.

The person responsible for the breakfast bar which consisted of mini-muffins, cereal, coffee, milk and oj would crunch up the cereal and feed the birds at the end of the bar. Hmmm- sanitary issues?

On the bright side - we did receive our wake up call every morning at 5am sharp!

It is a 3-minute walk to the beach and can also be reached on foot with a longer walk to all major Miami Beach locations. Approximately 30 minutes to Ocean Drive. The room was very modern by American standards. Much is reminiscent of the positive at IKEA. The bed was very big and the room was very quiet and clean. Unfortunately there was no kitchen, table or similar. So a breakfast was not possible here. A big problem is the parking. They are right outside the door, but they cost money until 3 o'clock in the night and you can only pay 3 hours at a time. For 2 nights (3 days) we have paid about 70 ‚Ç¨ to parking fees. A tip, you can wait for the first 5 minutes pay and then immediately pay again 3 hours and extend the hours. So you spell yourself getting up at midnight. ;-)

Das Bett war sehr gro√ü und das Zimmer war sehr ruhig und sauber. Leider gab es keine K√ºche, Tisch oder √§hnliches. So war ein Fr√ºhst√ºck hier nicht m√∂glich. Ein gro√ües Problem sind die Parkpl√§tze. Sie sind zwar direkt vor der T√ºr, aber sie kosten bis 3 Uhr in der Nacht Geld und man kann nur 3h auf einmal bezahlen. F√ºr 2 N√§chte (3 Tage) haben wir ca. 70‚Ç¨ an Parkgeb√ºhren gezahlt. Ein Tipp, man kann nach dem ersten Zahlen 5min warten und dann sofort wieder 3h bezahlen und die Stunden verl√§ngern.

You feel like you are sitting somewhere in the Mediterranean.  It's a great date spot as well as a place to get awesome cocktails.

I came here with some girlfriends and we had a great time!! We came just to get drinks but we ended up staying for dinner because the vibe here is amazing!! This is the most beautiful rooftop and you will get the most amazing photos as well!!

When you get out of the elevator you get greeted by the most friendly staff (rare in NYC). Then they take your temperature with a super cool photo monitor (you have to see it to believe it!).  There is hand sanitizer at every table and the servers are wearing masks. We appreciate the level of high safety measures being taken!! Thank you!!

Love this place and it should definitely be on your bucket list if you are in NYC.

I switched to wine after trying a variety of ~5 cocktails. The waitress was obviously up selling us as soon as we got to the table - offered shots (which we got), prompted us to get better alcohol instead of house (which we did); and yet service was still extremely slow. We had to ask for water multiple times. Our food came out before drinks.

Mushroom pizza was pretty good; better than the pepperoni, tomato and pepper one (tasted like Subway).

Instagramable place; cool views; but overpriced and service sucked. Would go back if the night option presented itself but not necessarily dying to go back.",['food']

You have to make reservations in advance and pay a deposit but it gets added to your bill. The menu isn't that intense so we stuck with the pizza but the bar will make whatever drinks you want. The staff is super friendly and honestly it feels like the Hamptons in Manhattan. Should definitely check it out. They also give you a huge bowl of spicy cashews if you order it. We didn't finish half of those cashews lol but they were good.,[]

To many amazing options close by. Go elsewhere.

We arrived around 530p on a Saturday.¬† The place was at less than 50% occupancy.¬† Yet, they insisted on placing our party of three at a two person setup. Rude.

Beyond this, they had the windows shut and did not have the ac on. The place was a sauna - break a sweat hot. We opted to leave.

Ezy, the floor manager, was rude to my party and the one in front of us.¬†¬† Customer service is not his strong suit. When we left another couple left as well and the only sizable party they had left as well.

To add insult to injury the uniforms are horrendous. Very 1950s nursing home. I don't know who the are catering to.

There are several waterfalls along the edges of the way, just enough falling to keep you cool. With two towel/shop areas on both sides of the pool makes them easily accessible to swimmers. There were plenty of chairs, but fewer umbrellas so that might be a problem on busy days if you want shade. There is a shallow pool for non-swimmers and babies.

This is actually a pretty good idea by Hilton. You are able to become an owner and stay in places for only $67 a night. There only catch is they do attempt to gather a down payment and you will have a monthly payment until the ownership price is paid off. The price varies from couple to couple and/or family to family, depending on what you feel you will be able to utilize as far as room size and the amount of stays per year you estimate you will utilize. It can be as low as 8500 to 30 or 40 thousand an ownership and once you pay that amount off you don't pay anymore but keep continuing to reap more of the benefits of being an owner while you're paying and after it's paid off as well. The staff was very friendly and pleasant, although these guys and gals are slick and have been trained well it did seem not to be as genuine as they would have you believe. Once again the service was amazing and the staff was super friendly but if you anything about sales you can see right through each tactic that the sales individuals attempt to deploy. They are trained well and do a great job at it. The last thing I will add is they are not however pushy. They present the deal, shine it up and serve it to you on a nice shiny platter, but once you deny the offer they continue to be nice but stop selling the plan, great job. The only real negative reply I will add is we were told we would receive a free gift for hearing the presentation and we did not.",[]

The Versailles Tower is one of the hotel's old buildings from 1954. Unfortunately, despite all the thorough renovations, this is noticeable in the layout of the rooms, and the room is also extremely noisy. Photos attached.
Spacious room with carpet, 2 king-size beds, desk, wardrobe with safe (big enough for a laptop). Unfortunately, all the background noises from the neighboring room penetrate almost unmuffled: TV sound, really every word of conversation, children's screams, everything ...
Private balcony, furnished, with views of both the ocean and Indian Creek and Miami. Great! Marble bathroom tiny, but in good condition and relatively clean. When the door is open, a third of this is in the way of the sink! A relic from the 50s! Here there and there is a lack of ‚Äúattention to the detail‚Äù: rust on the chrome surfaces of the side table and the desk. And overall, the room looks a bit old-fashioned.
Prices are high, also very high: $ 339 per night WITHOUT breakfast is the price for the room shown in the photos, which I only occupied, plus 80 taxes per night! A sensor is attached to the mini-bar in the room. Whoever opens it and does not take anything out has to pay an unknown amount in $, s. Photo to prevent those who cool drinks they have brought with them. ¬Ω liter of water costs $ 10 in the room, a can of Heineken or Corona costs $ 8.
2 stars, because the price is simply unjustified for such a room despite the overall layout of the Fontainebleau.

Der Versailles Tower ist eines der alten Geb√§ude des Hotels von 1954. Das merkt man leider trotz aller gr√ºndlichen Renovierungen am Zuschnitt der R√§ume, und extrem hellh√∂rig ist das Zimmer auch. Fotos anbei.
Gro√üz√ºgiger Raum mit Teppichboden, 2 Kingsize Betten, Schreibtisch-Anlage, Kleiderschrank mit Safe (gro√ü genug f√ºr ein Laptop). Leider dringen wirklich alle Nebenger√§usche vom Nachbarzimmer nahezu unged√§mpft her√ºber: Fernseh-Ton, wirklich jedes Wort von Gespr√§chen, Kindergeschrei, alles ...
Eigener Balkon, m√∂bliert, mit Blick sowohl aufs Meer als auch den Indian Creek und Miami. Toll! Marmor-Bad winzig klein, aber guter Zustand und relativ sauber. Bei offener T√ºr steht diese zu einem Drittel im Weg vorm Waschbecken! Ein Relikt aus den 50ern! Hier da und fehlt es an ‚Äûattention to the detail‚Äú: Rost auf den Chromfl√§chen des Beistellteischs und der Schreibtischanlage. Und insgesamt wirkt der Raum etwas altbacken.
Preise sind hoch, auch sehr hoch: $ 339 pro Nacht OHNE Fr√ºhst√ºck ist der Preis f√ºr das auf den Fotos abgebildetete Zimmer, das ich allein bewohnt habe, und dann kommen noch 80 Steuern pro Nacht hinzu! An der Mini-Bar im Zimmer ist ein Sensor angebracht. Wer sie √∂ffnet und nichts entnimmt, muss einen mir unbekannten $-Betrag zahlen, s. Foto, um denjenigen vorzubeugen, die selbst mitgebrachte Getr√§nke k√ºhlen. ¬Ω liter Wasser kostet $ 10 auf dem Zimmer, eine Dose Heineken oder Corona $ 8.
2 Sterne, da der Preis trotz der Gesamtanlage des Fontainebleau einfach f√ºr solch ein Zimmer ungerechtfertigt ist.",[]

My last visit I wasn‚Äôt to satisfied with the cleanliness of my bed and sheets. Recycling sheets and pillows after a long time of being used, is completely unsanitary. A low budget hotel or not, there‚Äôs certain requirements when running an establishment like so. Also, I just currently came here and I‚Äôve never heard of a hotel that doesn‚Äôt let you check in until 4 pm especially when check out for previous over night guests is at 12 pm. No one can wait in the lobby. I took 2 hours to get here and I‚Äôm pregnant, the receptionist explained that I couldn‚Äôt wait until check in time which was only a hour to come after my arrival. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. With the amount of funds this hotel receives everyday there is no reason that you guys still have yet to buy new things, upgrade items and at least train your workers with common courtesy. Honestly, if this problem persists... as a active member of the community board, I will gladly bring this problem to their attention and push for a thorough investigation.

You can take a nice stroll to Madison Square Park or the Empire State building. I love the TV service and mini fridge and the suite setup I had. However, I can only see more negatives about this hotel than I can see positive. I want to honestly say the hotel isn't worth what I paid for. It has cheap quality for expensive prices. I was already concerned when the receptionist looked like he didn't know what he was doing every time I walked through the lobby. I was right to be concerned because they put me in the wrong room. I will applaud the fast speed of resolving that issue, however; there were only two outlets in the room, both at very awkward and inconvenient locations. At one point the outlet fried my charger, forcing me to buy a new one after the receptionist looked clueless about my complaint. The toilet doesn't flush all the way, you'll have to flush it twice to get even a small sheet of tissue down. That was a big turn off for me. They deducted an extra $25 as a deposit in case there was any damages in the room after I left, this would be returned to my card if no damages were made. I can definitely understand this, but it was not mentioned to me at all upon booking my room which was very upsetting. When I first initially reserved the room, I was informed my grand total would be $380, but then the price raised to $410, and then it raised to $477. I don't understand why because I booked the room for what it was worth at $380 but ended up paying $477, such a total ripoff. I saw reviews and was warned by a random user to book somewhere else. But knowing we as humans have different tastes, I booked it anyway to give it a chance. But I'm very bitter about my stay overall and will not suggest this place to anyone. I wish I took the advice to book somewhere else.",[]

They are not empowered to do anything; not even pass on defect info to maintenance. They won‚Äôt even accept deliveries (courier) on behalf of guests, so I had to camp out at reception all day for UPS to arrive. The rooms are tiny, 15 ft by 15 ft at most and the ensuite toilet was an afterthought. Check in time is 1600 hrs; if you arrive early, as we did, we had to leave and come back after 1600 hrs. They charge USD7 for every piece of luggage stored in their luggage room.  A rip off, if you ask me; but we didn‚Äôt have a choice. Opportunist capitalists!

On the plus side, at USD29/night the rate is considered the cheapest in NYC; the fridge is large and they supply towels. The only useful thing reception did for us was to give us two sets of keys.

The entrance is super sketchy and unless you're from NYC you'd think it was illegitimate. The room took way too long to be cleaned, there was still hair in the shower catch and our toilet was clogged when we got there. When we asked for someone to come up and help, the front door girl showed up with a plunger and meekly handed it to us to do ourselves.

On top of that, who ever hired the contractors to develop this hotel should be sued and then lose their licenses, there was dried grout all over the tiles, holes and pencil markings all over the walls, there are light switches that don't turn anything on and lights that have no switch! Our phone wasn't working so the handy man had to come in and out several times; turns out it wasn't even plugged in. The walls are incredible thin, we could hear someone else's TV blaring from down the hall and the gap between the door and floor is so huge you can see the feet of those who walk by.

The positives, very close to the subway and has a market right next door. The room are a nice space and while there clearly needs to be a management overhaul, it's clear that the front desk staff and handymen have good intentions and were very polite.",[]

The neighborhood was nice, a lot more quiet compared to uptown where we usually stay, especially at night.
