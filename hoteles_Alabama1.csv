The ice bucket in the room was dirty. Coffie pot was dirty. Inside of lamp shade on the night stand was gross. Looked like dried up drink with hair stuck to it. Dried up toothpaste on bathroom door. We asked for a non smoking room, that room smelled like cigs. Candy machine in office/lobby had old Hot Tamales. But i do have to say that the man and lady that woked there on the night i stayed was nice.
