Family would call the be transferred to the phone in our room, and the first thing they would say was, ""Wow, that lady was rude."" (The owner's wife)
The housekeeping lady smokes at the cart and the smoke comes into your room when she does her rounds. When we first got here it took 4 days to get a drain plug for the tub so that we could bathe our children. There were dead birds rotting on the patio for 3 days and we had to ask someone to come clean it up. And the owners came in to switch out mattresses while we were in our room, and they made us go stand in the parking lot. The new mattresses were rock hard like a damn granite slab and the sheets didn't fit properly. Trying to get some of the air let out of the mattress took 8 hours and I had to go back down and complain for someone to come because they didn't get controllers for the sleep number mattresses they installed and the sheets popped off every time we rolled over (but they fit, really).
The guy at the desk and the maintenance man were extremely nice and personable, but they were diamonds in the ROUGH. After putting up with all of this without much complaint, they waited til the last second to tell us that we couldn't stay another week because they were booked up and we had an hour to find another hotel in order to go to after our stay had to be extended. Trust me... NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU SAVE. This place is trash.","wifi, parking lot, parking"

I used to go there now and then just to get away from everyone and the weather, watch some HBO and just be quiet. All the hotels in town now are modern, over priced and don't feel right being in this little town, But, we are turning into a blue sign on the highway, Gas Food Lodging, after all.",food

There is a little drama but if you keep to yourself here then no one bothers you. The managers do a great job here.

Here it is.  I've been a long term guest here for a year and a month,  and although the place has potential much needs improvement starting with management and staff.  First,  it must be understood that customer service and satisfaction is a requirement for any service and hospitality business,  for without that you have nothing.  So,  more sincere smiling faces and quality customer service and less rude behavior and attitude.  Second, be mindful and selective of the individuals and groups you rent or sell a room to.   There have been two deaths- one seemingly suicide and the other a double homicide,  within one month of  each other.  You can Google the information to the validity of what I say (two found dead at Crossland of Memphis as the article reads).  I don't believe in coincidences,  I believe in connections, so renting and selling rooms to individuals of questionable and colorful (shady) character just to make a profit and increase your numbers for corporate approval is dead wrong.  No pun intended.  Third,  treat your long term guests with the proper respect that is due. Anyone who is willing to put up with all that happens at your business while they are in a transitioning period despite the obvious failures,  have earned more respect than given. In summary,  do that which is needed to change your reputation and way of doing business so that you may improve your status and reputation as a one star and two star Hotel and Extended Stay Hotel to a four star and five star Hotel  Whether your company will heed the reviews and suggestions provided by honest and honorable guests and potential customers,  or ignore and dismiss them entirely your choice and decision.  I hope you will choose and decide the righteous,  fair,  and just one for the greater good.",

My family had to relocated here for about 2 months now and we have had no major issues.
As of 1-19-18 they were in the process of doing renovations such as changing all of the locks on the room doors, they added a breakfast area in the lobby, and also updated some of the rooms.
We had the comfort of being in an efficiency style room with a full kitchen (stove/oven, refrigerator, and cabinets). I have kids so this was very much needed.
The staff is friendly and they don't impose.
The parking lot is always clean. I haven't heard an abundance of noise while being here and the traffic is not bad. But if you are picky and prefer luxury and/or upscale hotels; you should probably check their other property Hotel Ylem on S.Main. Overall
I am satisfied with my stay here at Econo Lodge and would recommend it.","parking lot, parking"

I've been staying here for nearly 2 months so far and would reccomend this place. This place is huge! It is a former Ramada hotel that went out of business sometime last year and whoever bought it decided to turn it into a short term apartment building/week to week hotel. They are the cheapest short term/week to week motel that you're going to find in Orlando. I pay $220 a week for myself (all inclusive: including Tax, utilities, garbage, etc). More people cost extra. They have security at night so although it's located a half mile from the Orange County jail, you won't feel unsafe here. Front desk staff are friendly as well. My only complaint is that the internet doesn't work often in my room but my room might be too far away from the router/front desk. There are also bugs in my room daily as well, although they did spray the rooms recently. My room does have a balcony which is a huge plus and there's a pool open during the warmer months. Would recommend staying here overall!!",pool

It cost $11 for the hotel buffet lots to choose from including made to order omlets and eggs. This is an older hotel built in 1954 furniture is older but not that old. Beds where very comfortable. We stayed in an ocean front room with beautiful views. That is the pros. However I was not happy with the fact that hotel indoor hot tub didn't work it was very very cold!!! Staff was consulted and they said it would be fine the next day, it wasn't. So if that is important to you like it is to me. One of the big reasons why we booked here. We still had a great time here. Would u book here again...YES. I was worried after I booked I saw so many negative reviews. I can't back any of them up. For the price you can't do wrong!!",

Broken security doors to the outside, in the back building I was greeted with the smell of skunk in the hallway and hit stifling air, then I found one of the two rooms I reserved.  The doors would not lock on either doors!  They could be opened from the inside lock (that wouldn't lock) and the outside (that wouldn't lock).  I had them reprogram the locks.  Then one door still would not lock.  They switched our second reserved room (one I reserved for our friend) from a king bed to two singles, not an issue.  We went out for the night and came back.  Then we were locked out of our room and our belongings were in the room!  Finally gained entrance and despite the outdated room, fell asleep about 11:30 to be woken up when my husband's friend called at 1:30 am.  His room had BEDBUGS!!!!  They moved him, after accusing him of smoking pot (I am guessing because he is black, even through he is on a business trip with my husband who is white).  They both smoke cigarettes, but I guess if you are checking into this hotel, hotel staff must assume you are a druggy because it is that kind of facility this is... Just my opinion.  So, after all this we finally get some sleep, to awaken then next morning to NO HOT WATER!!!  By this time we just want to check out, leave this place behind, and hope to God that we don't take bedbugs home with us.","pool, parking"

I wouldn't have stayed there but we are displaced by hurricane Michael n desperately needed a roof over our heads .. We were at sterling shores in destin before we came there n had no issues so i feel as if he did this so that he didn't have to pay for the deep clean .. Not to mention check out is at 10am ..

A lot of druggies, prostitution, etc.. No blankets just sheets everything was dirty no room service. I don't even think they do room service after customers check out of the room. They just have 1 or 2 towels the most. I wanted a non smoking room and got a  room that smelled like smoke carpet was dirty. There was cigarette ashes on the TV Stand. You have to be checking if your car isn't stolen or broken in to. There was glass of broken windows on the parking lot. Just the worse hotel I've stayed in. Thought about staying more nights before I saw what the room look like luckily they only accepted cash and only had enough cash on me for 1 night. I couldn't wait to move back to Motel 6 went to this motel cause wanted to save a little more money but wasn't worth it. Found a website where I could get Motel 6 for $50/night plus taxes which was cheaper than booking on the Motel 6 website. Also didnt had a remote control for the TV had to call twice to the front office cause there was no way to turn the TV on without the control. So stay somewhere else is not even good for an over night stayed you'll definitely regret it if you end up staying  here Only good things of this motel was cable TV and that they allow pets but overall not worth it","pool, parking lot, parking"

Martinsburg Motel,0x89ca028aad110b19:0xd993b2743cc70075,,['Motel' 'Hotel'],,"This motel/efficiency apartment may seem really nice at first; The efficiency apartment I'm in has the absolute minimum space, which is really fine, but there are problems that arose just after the first week here.

For one, there is WiFi, but it might as well not exist. My phone won't connect to it at all, so it has to use up its mobile data, which can be quite costly… My laptop will rarely actually connect to it, but its speed is so slow that I can rarely watch video that's ever standard quality. On my last days here, it worked better, but your milage may vary…

Next, the BIG problem. Me, my mom, and a friend moved in here, and that was fine for the first week, but just yesterday, people come and claim the apartment is only for two people, and said people need ID, neither of which were rules established when getting the room! This means this motel can and will come up with rules to kick you out quickly, without giving you a refund!

We aren't the first that had to deal with this. Others here have been seen being visited by management then kicked out. This is NOT the way to treat people perfectly abiding by the rules they were initially given!

Due to these big problems, I'm giving Martinsburg Motel a 2/5 rating. Come here if you want, but don't expect to stay long, as they will find the smallest problem in order to kick you out and earn more money…","wifi, spa"

Outstanding customer service very fair and understanding even if you hit you with a violation all you got to do is go talk to him and he resolved it for you with a warning. So all but all in all since I've been there they have been during Reconstruction of their hotel facility to upgrade to make it better suit the residents and the community.,

I travel often for work and choice hotels use to be on my list to search for affordable clean rooms. I regret that one owner of a Quality Inn Mesa AZ has forever changed my view and narrowed my search to a few of their competitors. I was charged for smoking in a non smoking room and while I do smoke I never smoked in the room in fact smoked outside with hotel staff and had names and details. I do not smoke in my home and have stayed in hundreds of non smoking rooms this is the first time being charged a fee. I had the option of smoking room at check in and declined as I do not smoke inside. I attempted to work this out with the Mesa AZ Quality Inn and while they did lower the $250 fee they still called me a liar by charging anything. I also stayed at La Quinta and a Marriott on the same trip in non smoking rooms no fees. I rented a non smoking car no fees but because of the apparent greed of this owner I am charged fees. There was also several other issues with my stay but I was trying to be the good guest and get along only to be charged a fee for it. I am disgusted with the service and fleecing of Quality Inn Mesa and the Choice Hotels brand for allowing owners to get away with it. I will no longer be giving Choice Hotels my business and I will encourage friends and coworkers to do the same. #qualityinnmesaneveragain #choicehotelsneveragain","wifi, pool"

The steam room wasn’t a very good smell, the pool was full of children (the hotel closed their outdoor pool so everyone went through the spa). when I entered the women spa room, I entered to four little kids watching cartoons. I mean it was not even relaxing and I felt so embarrassed because it was his birthday gift.  I don’t recommend this spa because of the environment they give out.

Once I got ahold of the right person at corporate, there was knock on my door and maintenance had it fixed in no time. Actually it got a little too hot! They could have gotten things a little cleaner ie, the freezer was pretty bad,I cleaned it as well as I could; the bedspread was kinda bad, but I had brought blankets and linens so I just put those on, everything else I cleaned myself. There was no plate in the microwave to rotate the food but it could be used and the stove had a minor issue but I fixed that myself. I have to say for staying six weeks it wasn’t too bad.

When I got to my room, it seemed nice at first glance, but as I got unpacked and settled in, I realized this place was a dump. Ceiling in shower was falling down. You could tell there had been holes in the wall, they were poorly repaired. There were outdated sprinklers loaded with built up dust. One of the wall lights didn't work, I even swapped light bulbs to check before requesting a replaced bulb. There was a safe in the room was was outdated. The microwave was small and rusted. The mini fridge was small, but worked. They had a single serve coffee pot, looked new/never used, but the packet of creamer and sugar were hard/old. The bed appeared clean, smelled clean, and somewhat comfortable. There were 2 reclining chairs in the room. I had to pull them away from the wall In order to fully recline, which was pretty much the middle of the room. But since the room was just as a place to stay while in town and I wasn't actually hanging out there, I didn't pay too much attention to issues I could see at first. But later, after I got back to the room, I went to use the bathroom and found, not only dust/dirt on the wood reinforcement used to hold the toilet paper roll holder, but it looked like there was a booger or earwax or something also there. This made me look around. I found more on the wall near the bed...as if someone picked out the wax out of their ear and wiped it on the wall. Not sure what this was, but Gross! I cleaned it up.

The next morning, as I went to leave, housekeeping was opening my door...without first knocking.

A little later that day, before their check-in time of 3pm, I came back to the hotel to check-out due to a change in plans. I requested a refund for the unused night and was told ""No refunds"". I told them it was due to a family emergency, and still the answer was ""no"". The woman I spoke with was rude and heartless, cold, and lacked compassion. She clearly stated she was running a business and they don't give refunds. Well it was clearly understood this family cared nothing for their customers.

If you're looking for a place to stay in Macon, I recommend NOT staying here. It's not worth the $120 I paid/lost.",

This will be my one and only lesson about actually reading reviews and not just going off of overall rating. Let's start from the top, shall we? First off, the big no no was the ants. We had sugar/ghost ants that showed up as quickly as we did. When I brought it to managements attention they copped an attitude and asked if I had food out. Of course we had food on the counter (the place included a kitchen) but nothing that wasn't sealed and no crumbs, etc. We went to dinner when they 'sent someone out'. Needless to say our guests never left, nor seemed discouraged by the treatment. Second major offense, they charge you a daily resort fee, but DON'T service the rooms daily. Our trash wasn't even changed until almost 5pm. When we asked the guy why our room wasn't serviced, he couldn't answer due to a language barrier, but managed to express that it wasn't every day. They claim in their own description they offer designer toiletries but I beg to differ. The ""queen"" beds were terrible, all springs and oddly small for being a queen. Lastly, our reservation stated ""ocean front suite"" but our room didn't even face the ocean. When this was brought up along with the ant problem I was given another snide remark and told that they couldn't move me anyway because they were booked.

There are several waterfalls along the edges of the way, just enough falling to keep you cool. With two towel/shop areas on both sides of the pool makes them easily accessible to swimmers. There were plenty of chairs, but fewer umbrellas so that might be a problem on busy days if you want shade. There is a shallow pool for non-swimmers and babies. Two floats per room are free, additional floats are available for purchase.
We had lunch at the pool bar and the food was delicious. But, if staying in your lounger is required, there are servers that will come to you. Overall a very enjoyable, relaxing environment!","pool, Swimming, food"

Cons: They didn't have any apts for rent(they were remodeling though) and they have an infestation of RiffRaff ppl.

Red Lion Inn & Suites Spokane Downtown North,0x549e1f34a2dec085:0xbb430997fe802dba,,['Hotel' 'Pet friendly accommodation'],,"Wish I'd looked more closely at the reviews on here before I got my room. Just like one said I am absolutely shocked that Red Lion would put their name on a place like this. If this is a newly acquired property that they are going to upgrade, warn us before we book the room and don't charge Red Lion rates!! This place is run down. It smells dank.

As others said. It's not well managed. I booked a room for my birthday with a jacuzzi tub. Thinking I was going to treat myself, but for some reason there were none available. All I get is, well we work with Expedia and they sent over a different reservation then you actually reserved. Didn't matter that I had an email showing that I had booked a premium suite. I saw that they wanted to charge another guy $15 for changing his room. They should have given me at least $150 back for this.

After getting to my room and seeing how wrong it was. A jacuzzi suite probably would have been worse. This was a definitely sleep on top of the blankets kind of place. I've attached a couple of pictures. I am not sure what the heck is all over this chair. But I'm sure if we had a blacklight we would all want to throw up!  As another reviewer also said; it was hot as Hades in this room! Turned the AC on full-blast and went to dinner. Gone for a couple of hours and came back and it was still way too hot. Didn't cool down until the middle of the night.

Breakfast was not impressive either. I would say the one positive about the breakfast is they actually had scrambled eggs. Other than that just typical. For spending almost $150 for the night, I could have had so much better just down the road!

that's for the managers replies to the comments. They sure don't seem to be getting anywhere do they?! You have wonderful responses thanking people for their opinions, but obviously nothing is being done to change the situation. Lower your rates or do something differently 😉",

I didn't expect much from a Roadway Inn or of any Choice Hotel for a matter of fact. But this place takes the cake for the worst at service and the absolute nastiest room that I have ever stayed in. My military accommodations in Kuwait in Iraq were more attentive and clean. You shouldn't use this place if you have small children or a compromised immune system for the fact that you are likely to end up in the hospital. The place is filled with pubic hairs and cigarette smoke. The staff is miserable to include the highly impaired manager whom was clearly under the influence of something strong. Tony's attitude is award winning and demeaning. The personal insults and disregard of people with disabilities was just shameful to witness. Choice Hotels will be hearing from me and in particular about Tony's questioning of a Desert Storm Veterans disability. Tony the nasty receptionists whom has a personal calling to involve herself in others conversations and unwitting ability to propel insult toward customers valid complaints. I just can't explain how unbecoming this experience has been.,

From the moment we contacted the wildflower country inn we knew immediately it was the place! We live in San Antonio and wanted something rustic and intimate. We had a small wedding of about 43/45 total guests. Carly, and Natalie made this experience extremely easy! I would say almost too easy!!! I did not stress over a single thing whatsoever and I tell everyone this because I am very particular with every certain thing. Carly and Natalie put together an entire event only after seeing about 4/5 photos of ideas I had! I stress every year trying to put together our daughters birthday parties and let me tell you... this was the smoothest process! They have so much experience and went over everything and guided us through choices! We rented out the main house to have family and friends enjoy the stay with us and definitely helped since we live an hour away. The main house was beautiful!!! We enjoyed the views, the peacocks, the quietness just everything! The day of went smooth with constant communication and the walk through of everything! I was scared I was going to forget something but I felt like I had tiny helpers along the way! It was truly amazing and everything we could have hoped for! We got the lodging, the decor, the ceremony, reception, the amazing planner all in one place! They also created a bouquet for myself and a boutonniere for my husband! I told him constantly how much I loved the bouquet!!! It surpassed my expectations 1000 times over!!  Literally everything we could of wanted and more! A million thank You’s over and over again!!!","parking lot, parking, spa"

The good:
- The service was amazing. Everyone we interacted with had the utmost level of professionalism. The doormen greeted me by name each time we came and went which was a really nice touch.
- The room had an incredible view of the Bay.
- Room service was very quick.
- Staff was very fast to respond to the Four Seasons in-app messaging.
- Everything was clean and modern.
- The crab and shrimp omelette was delicious.
- Wireless charger and USB ports on the nightstand was a nice touch.

The bad:
- The was no in-room dining menu in our room nor any instructions on where to find one. We had to ask for a link to the menu.
- The coffee was absolutely terrible.  I’m not exaggerating when I say it was some the worst I have ever had my life.  After disliking it in one meal, they provided it complimentary in another meal but it was still quite bad. The problem likely isn’t the preparation but rather the selected beans. SF has a number of amazing roasters, they should seek out a better option from a local roaster.
- Doors slamming all morning long. I don’t know if it was Staff or guests, but from around 8 am too 11 am, doors near our room were constantly being opened and closed and quite loudly.  This woke me up and prevented me from getting as much sleep as I wanted to.  The doors need to be assisted so they close quietly.
- The toilet paper was completely awful, very thin and quite abrasive. This was so pretty surprising detail and I can’t begin to imagine how the product they were using would even be considered remotely up to their standards.

Overall, it wasn’t too bad but I don’t think it lived up to their reputation. I know they recently reopened and there are mistakes to be expected but something like low quality toilet paper doesn’t really have an excuse.  I hope this review will allow them the opportunity to make improvements where there are currently deficits.

I’m not sure I would stay there again at that price point given the above issues.",

The people who work/live here are aware of the problem!! This is not an easy review to write because I really feel uneasy about this whole situation.
My boyfriend and I decided to stay here and we soon regretted it.
Upon entering the lobby I noticed lots of shopping bags, and people's personal items sitting around like it was being actively used as someone's living room. I'm a laid back person though, so this isn't really a concern to me even now.
We stayed in our room for a couple of hours, went to the store and returned with a few snacks. Everything seemed fine.
I noticed that my wrist started to itch like I had some kind of irritation, but I initially thought nothing of it.
Soon we were getting ready to go out for the evening, and when I was putting on my tennis shoes, I saw horrifyingly, that there was a BED BUG on my shoe sole! I called my boyfriend over and showed him. He tried to get it off to put on the counter to get a better look, but he dropped it on the carpet and we couldn't find it after that. As fast as we could, we began packing our things to leave. We put everything in the bathroom and ran downstairs to report it.
The owner said absolutely nothing to us, he just opened the register and began giving back our money.
We quickly got our stuff and got out of there. We then spent at least an hour trying to find another place to stay. This took important time away from what was supposed to be a lovely weekend.
I have nothing to gain or lose from doing this review, but I know that bed bugs are EXTRAORDINARILY hard to get rid of. We don't want anyone to get them.
We thoroughly searched through our items, and we definitely got lucky. There are others who I'm sure won't be so lucky. Please don't take any chances. Just find somewhere else to stay.","tennis, parking"

Even for a Monday night the place was busy, and as golfers came in at the end of the afternoon, the outdoor restaurant area filled up. Live music was playing and the service was great. I also have a spa only saltwater pool as well as a family pool in the main area.
We are locals but decided to stay for a fun one night staycation. I have been plenty of times before for the spa, for dinners and lunches, as well as a few company Christmas parties during the holiday season. During the holidays it's also decorated beautifully with Christmas trees, rolling fireplaces and strong lights. Love staying here!","restaurant, pool, massage, resort, spa"

I think you could easily get it to five stars if they brought it up to date like upgraded the gym that's in there and actually put in a treadmill the place has racquetball court but not sure that's a big corporate team-building thing anymore maybe in the 80s, I change that mortal workout room the kitchen is amazing but all the utensils look like they were bought at a yard sale ample supply of dishes and silverware and two dishwashers which is convenient overall it's a decent place but it's pretty far out of the way if you're not totally in the snow Sports",gym

My couple days in town were amazing, and it’s in no small part to due to Andrew, Nancy, the kids, and of course Pickle (the dog)!

Big plus- fantastically comfortable beds...better than the Hilton in anchorage! And yes, it’s really just about a 3 minute walk to the airport.

I would highly recommend a tour of the town or Point Barrow from Andrew if he’s available. He knows an awful lot about the place, and is happy to work with you to tailor the tour to what your goals are; mine were major sites and wildlife. He may be a transplant (like so many in Alaska), but he’s a wonderful ambassador for Utqiagvik!  I can’t wait to come back!

Black gooey substance under the lid of the toilet tank. What is it? Black mold? Old chocolate pudding? Anyones guess. Granted this isnt a place one normally looks when staying at a hotel. I get it, however, when forced to remove the lid to manually pull the chain to flush the toilet due to a broken handle, these types of things become apparent. Another example of being mindful (in this case regarding security) the door leaves quite a bit to be desired. While it's no secret that if someone wants in your room, it will happen. The large single pane window adjacent to the door with its rudimentary lock (circa 1950?) is not even a minor inconvenience when attempting to make entry. The damage to the door, due to a forced entry by either the police or someone with nefarious intentions, has caused the lock to not want to work properly nor align itself the frame. A nice white glow emits from it during daylight hours adding to the mood lighting and ambiance of the experience. Throw latch on the back is held in place with 3 screws, and due to the forced entry, isn't even secured to the door properly, leaving about a 1/8"" gap behind its base plate and the door.

Particularly enjoy the loud banging on our windows and doors, once at 2330 & 0100 for reasons unknown. Contact was not made with the unknown party on the other side of the awesome door, assume they were not trying to convert us to follow one particular religion nor sell candy bars.

Day 2 has been interesting. After returning from a long/dusty day on the job, a shower was needed. All set for an experience in the space shower, it was discovered that our towels were gone. Having previously used them the night before, hung up to air dry, they have since been removed from the room. Can cope with low pressure, not-as-hot-as-you-would-like temp, but the lighting. About 7 minu into it, the light in the shower shuts off. Luckily, the hydroponic quality light above the sink is more than capable of making up for this. At some point, the light may or may not turn back on. This seemingly is decided by how well the shower likes your personality or mood.

If one finds free time, sitting outside the door of your room provides for some entertainment. I'm sure ""people watching"" isn't for everyone but given the wide variety of transient foot traffic observed in and out of the location, some will find some value in the hilarity of it all. Trends can be noticed based upon the times. For example, later in the afternoon, the foot traffic is quite hurried, and these people make every effort to avoid contact with you, even eye contact while clutching pockets. The later evening crowd likes to stop for a brief moment and assess you, the watcher. The late-night/early morning crowd couldn’t care less about your presence and even may approach you with items for sale that aren't typically allowed by law. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule, most notably the large abundance of individuals mindlessly wandering with a variety of easy to notice hospital identification bracelets. Another interesting variety are the long term, or even, longer than normal stay types. The erratic behavior of these individuals will make you second guess yourself as to how you made it through life moving so slow, let alone establish a schedule of events you have laid out for yourself known to the common person as a routine. You may end up asking if you are in a hypnotic state by how slow you are in comparison. Additionally, your lack of leaving your room multiple times a night and driving off the property at speeds that rival the freeway makes you wonder how you can start your own 24 hour delivery service and profit from it all while you kick back on your double box spring ""bed"" and attempt to reconnect to the free Wi-Fi over and over and over and over and over again until you can finally check your email for new orders. At least the WAP does have isolation set so you can’t spy onto the devices of your fellow dwellers without a fight.","pool, spa"

I also noticed that the longer I stayed the worst my room service was. I would notice my trash hadn't been taken out or my towel/sheets are dirty.

I was also disappointed that they didn't follow their green guidelines. I never left my towels on the floor but they changed them everyday. I was really excited about their green policy.

Wifi is terrible also.

To be fair- i should mention the place seemed fairly quiet, a.c. worked well, and no one bothered me while inside. If your main priority is cheap- this is your place- but it still seems a little over-priced for lack of quality in the room...",

Basically whether I felt I got my money's worth.   Anyway I had been in this hotel previously (2011) and back then it was a total dump.  Anyway I stayed here last night and I will have to say I was VERY pleasantly surprised.

The reason I chose this hotel was it was 20$ cheaper than anything else I could find in the valley.   Anyway upon arriving they were actually doing some paving work in the parking lot so that was a sign that work was being put into it.   I checked in and the manager him self checked me in.  He was VERY friendly and when I asked for a top floor room he informed me that the top 2 floors were closed as renovations had started and were coming from the top floors down.   I was assigned to room 119.

I get to my room.  Yes it is quite dated from a modern hotel however I am the type of person who likes vintage and historic hotels.   The room was as clean as any other hotel I had stayed in and there was a fridge microwave and flat screen TV.  Like I always do, I pull off the bed sheets and such to inspect for cleanliness and found no issue.  Totally clean.  The bathroom was clean as well.  I know I may be a rarity but I LOVE a 1970s or 1980s looking hotel room and this property used to be one of my favorite brands, Howard Johnson and the room definitely reflected this.   Also as far as life safety, this hotel DOES have a sprinkler system and modern fire alarm system.

Sleep quality was excellent as a brand new climate control unit kept the room comfortable and generated enough white noise to where I could not hear any other noises..

I took a shower and the water pressure was more than adequate and the temperature was consistent.   The only issue with the shower is the drain was a little slow but it still worked.

THE INTERNET!!!   This hotel has the FASTEST WIFI I have EVER encountered in ANY hotel I have ever stayed in.  The speeds were over 40MBPS!   I was able to get alot of stuff done on my youtube channel thanks to the amazing internet here.

In the morning the manager asked me how my stay is and I informed him that I will be returning.   Check out was very simple and smooth as well.

IN CONCLUSION:
This is by no means a 5 star hotel,  it is a budget hotel and should be used as such.  This is the type of place you stay when you are looking for clean safe affordable lodging,  Not for your honeymoon or event like that.  Roanoke has  ALOT to do and you will not be spending much time in your hotel room so why pay alot for a room?   This hotel definitely gets the job done and the staff there is much more caring than some much higher end hotels I have stayed at.   So Yes I recommend this hotel if you are visiting the Roanoke valley and are looking for sensible affordable lodging.   I will be returning again.

PROS:
- GREAT LOCATION; practically walking distance to the airport terminal
- FRIENDLY STAFF; The manager definitely cares about the guests' satisfaction
- FAST INTERNET! ; 40MBPS + FASTEST internet I have used in ANY hotel
- Fridge and microwave; good if you need to stay a few days
- LARGE ROOMS! ;  Bigger than most modern hotels
- INTERIOR CORRIDOR AND ELEVATOR; you dont have to go outside to get to your room or lug bags up steps

CONS:
OLDER HOTEL; Not necessarily a bad thing but the hotel is dated but still clean as a new hotel
NO AUTOMATIC DOOR: You may have to set your bag down to open the front door but most hotels from the time period did not have automatic doors.","wifi, pool, parking lot, parking"

We were both shocked/stunned/relieved that our wipes stayed perfectly clean. Everything was spotless! I was so thankful because this was my first vacation since March. We wanted 2 bedrooms and two bathrooms. Believe it or not, we  picked this unit because of the beautiful blue floors.  It had been remodeled and looked exactly like the online pictures.  Every floor had washers and dryers (we didn’t use) and trash chutes. The elevators were fast, the pool was open but not crowded. Even on the beach, everyone kept their distance. Station One provided hand sanitizer in all common areas. You needed your key to enter all exterior entrances and fences. Safety first!   Wrightsville Beach is doing a great job of taking safety measures to make you feel safe. So much so, that I emailed their Mayor, Darryl Mills.  I will definitely visit again next year.

These ppl apparently just wish to run a clean safe establishment with minimal hassle. Which if you end up staying a while you realize transfers back to your benefit as well. The staff is friendly but doesn't welcome visitors. They watch EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE....nothing goes unnoticed. So if you trappin or trickin  I don't recommend this motel. But if you just want a clean safe and affordable room the Montclair is your spot. We have been here during the covid-19 pandemic and are grateful for being somewhere we really didn't have to stay hyper-vigilant about sanitizing everything or being exposed. Due to the size of this tiny motel and the ownership/staff being one family we all were more than happy to co-contribute to each other's continued health. Something that seems to have vanished over the years in communities. Thank you Montclair staff.,

In the lodge they has limited seating with dividers in between each table, and have built outdoor lodges that you can rent and keep all your things in. This is great if you go with a group of friends  or family because you have a private space outdoors. The only down side for Catamount was that their google operating hours are not accurate, they state they open at 10:00am when they actually open at 8:30am. This is major issue and can cause you to lose time on the slopes that you have payed for.","restaurant, resort, spa"

I have a few issues but if you're aware of these beforehand it's not a big deal.

1.  There are no supplies in the kitchen, i.e. sugar, salt, oil, etc. So if you want to cook you'll have to bring everything. There are utensils and cooking pots, very few but enough to get by.

2. We were here in October so it was a bit chilly and the beds only have a sheet and very light bed covering. No extra blankets available (I kept forgetting during the day to ask if there was the possibility of getting more blankets so I'm not sure if that's available)

But even with these (I prefer to eat out anyway while on vacation) the space is very nice and clean. We were in #5 which was right on the beach with a very nice size deck.  Nothing fancy but I would rather have the beach!

It's definitely larger than a hotel with two bedrooms, bath, living space with a firetv and open kitchen. Windows look out over the beach and Lake Huron. It was wonderful having the bedroom window open to hear the waves crashing on the beach to fall asleep to.

They are very pet friendly (extra charge for the animals) and the grounds are a nice space to walk our dogs. You can walk the beach to the park and pier with the dogs, on lease.

Will keep this place in mind for a summer stay and hopefully bring our bikes.",spa

It smelled very musky or like mold was somewhere in the floor or behind the walls that I couldn't see. Not pleasant at all, in fact my entire family left our 3 night stay with a very dry cough.  Also there was a 3rd key left in the room that was not ours and it worked on our door. Third the shower was ice warm cold and the floor grout was black. Forth the continental breakfast did not have hardly anything, no waffle mix the first day and no muffins or anything the second day. We arrived at the breakfast early so there should have been plenty in Stock. So basically if you want cereal and coffee then it's fine.

I was going to an event only 3 (three) exits away from my house and decided to make the expense of staying in a motel/hotel due to decorating the venue I did not want to travel to the house as the motel was closer. The price was fair, but the room had several issues.
The bathroom did not have toilet tissue.
There was a big stain in the tub.
The bathroom door  due to the painting would get stuck and it had the front coming off the door.
There was much evidence of the lack of dusting/housekeeping in the room from the baseboard to the top of the microwave and the refrigerator was not wiped down inside.

The pool had a filth ring around it, dead bugs everywhere and the windows were covered in webs. The food area for their free breakfast was a disaster with dried, crusty food on the waffle iron and cereal everywhere. The floors in the halls and rooms were filthy also. They clearly don't vacuum and after taking a shower, my son's feet were black from walking on the room floor. Also, I've never been to a hotel that doesn't put a comforter on their beds?

If your objective is a customer walking out with a good RV park timeshare, then make that deal make sense. Instead, the sales pitch is ""if you pay today, I can give you a $4k discount"" - what?!

I shot a 61 back and the course had broke me mentally. It's unfair to fault the course, but with that being said, you have to keep the ball in bounds on every hole. Shots wayward will be out of bounds and you have very little chance of finding the ball. Even good shots seem to end up penalized if your distance is off. I think if I had another go at it, I'd play safer clubbing down and being content with shots in play as the course wasn't overly long from the whites. Summing up, it's a really great course if you know how to play golf.","restaurant, parking lot, resort, parking"

Update: Immediately after I posted the below the person in charge retaliated against me by requiring me to move my car to an illegal disabled parking space (she used the term ""handicapped"") or be towed. She threatened to keep the money if we did not comply and refused to connect us with a manager or give us customer service information for Best Western. We are now forced to involve the police and the credit card company.

1. Charged me $50 over the price listed on the web even after I mentioned it.

2. Charged me a $20 “pet” fee for a federally recognized service dog even as I was giving the dog hand signals.

3. Made me park my car right by the freeway even though there were parking spots available; they parked a semi truck in those spots instead.

4. Charged a $200 “refundable” deposit that I have never seen at another Best Western location.

First thing in the morning the water  in the bathroom smells like sewage. I don't know what's up with that.

The air conditioner in the room was rather noisy on or off; you would think someone was coming through the window or in your room with the type of noise it was making.

While it has some extra amenities such as Direct TV and a gym, the parking structure is severely inadequate, the area is quite noisy, and the rooms and service are average at best. Customers should expect that they won't have an official parking spot and that the parking staff will have access to their cars and will either move them without notice or be blocked in. While the hotel is within walking distance to downtown LA, it is at the intersection of two very busy streets causing noise at all hours of the day and night. The surrounding areas would also probably be considered 'suspect' to those from other areas.

Check in was at 3. We got there around 2:30. They said our room wasn't clean that they needed to borrow house keepers from another hotel due to all their house keepers being out with the flu. At first we were understanding, people get sick and its a bad flu season. So we sat to wait. While sitting we seen signs that we wouldn't be getting the complimentary breakfast listed on the website because they are renovating, again whatever it happens. Well the staff that was there said they would go clean our room for us. But they went to the room and then came back and stood around talking for 30minutes. In that time the house keeper from the other hotel came and sat in her car smoking before even coming in. Once she did get in they stood around chitchatting before she even asked what rooms needed cleaned. She finally goes back to clean said room. And by this time it was about 3:15. Our 2 year old was getting antsy and the night worker came in to take over for the morning lady. They are standing there talking and our daughter is acting crazy so the night guy looks at us and says the chick will only be about 10 more minutes and that we would be okay. By this time we had been waiting 45 minutes already. Well 20 minutes goes by and its about 3:45 and the room still isn't clean and they are all acting like its normal. By this time my fiance had started calling other hotels. He came back in and it was almost 4 and we advised them we were canceling our reservation and didnt expect to be charged and the nought manager guy tried to tell us we were being unreasonable that he's sorry for the wait but just 10 more minutes. We advised we'd already been waiting an hour and a half for a reserved room so no we wouldnt wait 10 more minutes. Terrible experience. If you can go elsewhere do it. We had reservations in and they had no other vacancies so there was no excuse as to why no one could make sure the reserved rooms were cleaned before check in.

I took a bus to get here and had just ordered a pizza intending to eat it in my room only to find myself stuck eating a pizza on a dirty grimey sidewalk. If they are no longer in business and are going to answer calls to this location's phone number from some other hotel in some other city they ought to say what is going on when they answer the phone. I have no idea what city they actually booked my reservation for but am pretty upset to have been left stranded with nowhere to stay by this company which apparently could not even keep its grounds up to par with city ordinances. Very unhappt with this complete fiasco.,parking

But price and quality would make this hotel to check for. Overall good. Reception was very helpful. Taxi driver didn't like the hotel because of the neighborhood. He said be careful but next morning early I walked to the Jamaica–179 Street Station to Manhattan. It was perfectly fine to walk by nice houses and neighborhood. Breakfast was not good everything was packed. Room size for a 6.1 feet tall with two bags was small but it was silent. Silence is important because if you can't sleep it is not important how wide room that you stayed.  So overall above expectations.,taxi

This was the worst experience I have ever had at a motel.  We came in late on our way down to Orlando just to stay a night.  We were just tired and needed to sleep.

When we walked into the room the AC was off (it was JULY) and the room was terribly hot.  After a half an hour of the AC not cooling off the room we went to the office and complained.  They moved us into another room that honestly looked like it had not been cleaned.  We were so exhausted and the AC worked so we went to bed.  The next morning we realized there were used towels in the room...and it was absolutely disgusting. We didn't even feel like it was safe enough to take a shower....and we didn't.

The room looked like it had not been updated for 20 years.

Only paying $60 for the night we were not expecting an all inclusive resort here, but definitely didn't expect what was going on with this place.  We again went to the office to complain about the situation and after 30 minutes of arguing with them they only gave us $20 off the visit.

Later that day we realized they didn't refund us, but double charged us!  So we paid $120 for a place that shouldn't have been more than $20 a night.  We immediately called the office to complain about the situation and they were argumentative and wouldn't do anything about it initially and then later finally fixed the overcharge..but never gave us the $20 off...still charging the full price.  We then called Red Roof corporate office to complain. Later a regional representative returned our call and after explaining the entire ordeal they said they would fix the issue.  This after they didn't even believe what we were telling them and we flat out asked them ""would you stay at this motel""?

We still were not reimbursed the one night's stay to this day.

We later checked our statements to ensure something else didn't happen and all we got back was the overcharge.

I DEFINITELY would not recommend this place no matter how desperate you are....stay at the Best Western across the street.

The pic was taken in the parking lot to prove we were actually there.","pool, parking lot, resort, parking"

Super 8 motels in and around the Grand Rapids area have rooms from $50-$100  Must be tourist pricing??

Update… Thank you for responding. I found it interesting when you said ""if I had my way our room rates would be nowhere close to the rate we ask now.""  And then you followed it up with this… ""Daily I review all 15 of my competitors in the Petoskey area and set my room rates that reflect market demands.""
So it sounds like room rates are both completely out of your control, and completely under your control and changed daily.  You asked what my point was, but you pretty much made the point for me.  I can't resist including one more excellent quote from you…""vacation travelers will pay the steep rate in the  summer""  like I said originally, tourist pricing.","wifi, pool, casino, parking"

Now, I have only been once, for a convention. But they managed to mess up my room reservation, and the food in the restaurant (a concession) was mediocre, overpriced, and the service extremely poor. On top of that, the whole place is aging and dingy. ALL THAT SAID, I believe it's under fairly new ownership, and I'm willing to give them a chance to improve. The staff did manage to get me into something close to what I reserved, after some back-and-forth. The green areas are pretty, they have a large amount of function space, and there's plenty of parking. If they improve things (clean up, brighten things, redecorate a bit), and the concessioneers get their act together, it could be a very nice hotel. I'll let you know how this year's convention goes.","restaurant, pool, food, parking, spa"

Once it had so much mold, my kids and I had horrible migraines from it. They didn't care. Also didn't have paper towels, enough plates, toilet paper, trash bags, etc. The dryer wouldn't dry our clothes. This time, we asked for 2- 2 bedrooms that are connected. We originally had a 4 bedroom booked, but due to covid, pcs got pushed back, so had to reschedule. Well, they were rude asking us why we didn't book sooner or book a 4 bedroom, we told them we did and we had to push back our pcs, not our fault. Then they gave us 2- 2 bedrooms that don't connect. We have 5 kids, we specifically asked for them to connect because we can't just have our kids in a random area. The front desk lady was extremely rude and said they didn't have any rooms that connect at all. Which is a lie. All 2 bedrooms have 2 units that connect at the laundry area. Whatever, so we return the room keys that we can't use. To which she says they are gonna charge us anyway, even though they didn't give what we needed. The rooms are run down, only a few paper plates and plastic spoons. No spatula, no paper towels again, no sponge or dishrag to was dishes, dryer doesn't dry, microwave and stove are falling apart, just lacking a lot.
The management does not take care of these houses and they have no care when you call and bring up issues. I would have rather booked a small hotel room. At least it wouldn't be so rundown. Definitely won't be staying here, again.","laundry, spa"

It was inexpensive, even on a weekend that just about every other hotel was booked full. We checked for bed bugs and etc first thing when we checked in, and found no signs. We did find a yellow splatter-stained pillow that we asked front desk to exchange, which they did, no questions asked and no hassle. The fridge, which I saw other reviews complaining about, did accidentally freeze our waters and juice we had in there, but easily fixed by changing the temperature dial inside the fridge. In our case, it was cranked to 9, just remember to check it before placing food in there. The microwave was clean and worked well. The bathroom/shower was clean etc. The maids were awesome, we stayed several days and they respected our privacy with the sign on the door, and even caught us one morning as we were exiting to ask if we needed anything (which we did: another roll of toilet paper). The breakfast was simple: waffle makers, oatmeal and cereal. Juice and coffee, apples, toast, bagels, and muffins. Nothing hot, except the waffles you make. The hot tub was out of commission while we were there, so that was a bit disappointing, but the pool area and the exercise room looked nice (separate rooms but next to each other). We stayed with someone who got cold the first night, and we went to the front desk to ask for an extra blanket, and they gave us 2 nice fluffy thin warm blankets, again no questions asked. Everything about the hotel was honestly great for the few days we stayed, except for the other clientele, which they can't really prevent. We were next to one of the ""smoking"" corners, where people gather outside our window and smoke, and they were loud and sometimes, weirdly, almost unclothed. Also got woken up about 4am to a couple arguing in the hallway that went on for a while. And one of the days, as we were leaving probably around 10am, there were cop cars parked in front at the check-in, talking to one of the workers
I am assuming something was wrong like clientele breaking rules, but for what I don't know. And the last negative thing, for the first few days, when we walked down our hallway to our room, it smelled like bad microwaved curry. Again, the only negatives were the other clientele, just small snippets in our stay since we were mostly downtown in Muskegon for a festival this year Sept. 2019. I would stay again, and on the plus side, they also accept pets for a reasonable fee. We asked about it, but decided to keep our dog at home since Sunday we had to check out at 11am but we were still in town until 6pm that day.","gym, pool, food"

Years of the use/clean/repeat cycle have taken its toll. The bedding was comfortable, clean and fresh, and that's really the most important thing in a hotel room anyway. The linens are not new. Basic white towel and wash cloth. Soap, lotion and shampoo are provided. The tub drain needed plunging, so I did it myself and it drained better afterwards. Water pressure and heat were both excellent in sink and tub. Flat screen TV had a large selection of channels. Not all came in perfectly, but that's not a big deal because I didn't rent the room because I wanted to watch HBO anyways. Last week of May 2018, and it was comfortable enough that I never even used the AC unit. The couch in the room almost had a damp feel to it. Probably from years of being wiped down after checkouts. The doors felt sticky to me, but the knobs were clean feeling. There's room for a tractor trailer or two in the parking lot. I was able to get chinese delivery and Papa John's delivery during my week here at time I didn't feel like walking to McDonald's a couple tenths up the street. Most nights the hotel wasn't noisy past 10pm. Most. Doors don't hide any noise from other rooms, so rap music, loud TV, and sexy time are audibly shared with nearby neighbors. The toilet in the room upstairs would refill once an hour (easy to hear), so maybe a little maintenance is on the list for that room. That all being said, the staff is really very nice. Dan has a good group of folks working there and they make you feel like you're staying with friends. If you're fussy or picky, do yourself a favor and pay $20-$30 more to stay elsewhere. If you're looking for a comfortable bed to sleep in, clean towels, and don't mind a little jet noise from the airport landings occasionally (it's not O'Hare), then give ABVI Moline a try. I stayed in the room a week alone while my truck was in the shop. It's fine for me, but I doubt my wife would have enjoyed it. It's basically a 2* but add 1* for the staff. Thanks, Dan.

They were very nice and held our room for us until that evening at 10pm to check in after we were coming from an all day family reunion.  Very clean room and comfortable.
To top things off,  it was only $50 for the room.

I like old hotels with character but unfortunately this place has fallen into a rather sad state of disrepair. The parking deck is somewhat of a labyrinth with approximately two parking spots per floor (seriously). Upon arriving into the lobby I was greeted with a rather dungeonous space but I was willing to dismiss this due to the ""renovations"". So I rather optimistically checked in and and off we went to our room. The trip to the room felt a bit like urban exploring an abandoned building. Upon arrival to the room I began assessing the situation. At this time I realized neither the TV nor the air conditioning worked. I made the journey back down to the lobby to inquire about another room and was informed that the cable was out building wide and the AC is weak everywhere. The girl at the front desk was very nice, understanding, and asked if I'd like to check out (this is a regular occurrence there). I apologized and did so promptly.","pool, parking, spa"

I was forced to park at the very front of the hotel (north) and than walk around.  You are forced to walk in the parking lot because the sidewalk doesn't continue which was poor planning imo.  #2 The hotel has problems with their LG TVs.  They are aware of the problem, but instead of fixing or replacing them, they force their customers to repeatedly turn them on and off until they work.  Other than these 2 things, our stay was very pleasant.  he staff was very friendly and helpful, the lobby was attractive and comfortable.  Everything appeared clean.

We turned on the shower and the entire faucet blew off the wall and water was shooting everywhere. It had been badly caulked on and the tiles surrounding the shower were missing and had fallen off the wall, so this wasn't the first time. There were several large hooks hanging on the ceiling of our room with strings dangling down from them, leaving us to wonder what other guests had been doing. The bedspreads had some kind of white substance on them and the doors and walls were splattered and dirty. They have ancient televisions with bad reception and the breakfast is paltry. For $35 you get a bed in a dirty room with worn and outdated furniture. I have low standards but this place was just gross. They don't even include any shampoo. All you get is one square of crappy soap, one paper cup and tiny towels that feel like sandpaper, and are yellowed and dirty looking.","wifi, parking"

The hotel appears to be newer, and the rooms were clean and well kept. The conference space was also nice, and the food catered by the hotel was about what you'd expect from a mid grade hotel, but certainly not bad.

My only complaint is that the thermostats in the rooms were wonky and not very responsive. They may have had a motion sensor on them? I got to NY room, and it was set to a brisk mid- sixties, so I bumped it up to 72°. It didn't turn on right away, but eventually it did. I went into the bathroom to shower/freshen up. When I came back into the living space, the heater was not running, my room was at 69°, but the thermostat was still set to 72. Very odd. It's probably an efficiency thing, but not what I'd hope or want.

All in all, very nice mid tier hotel in Fargo with large meeting spaces.","gym, restaurant, pool, food, spa"

However, to our surprise it was a nice and clean comfortable room and stay. We stayed in room 118, non smoking (true) King size bed with clean comfortable linens, clean mini fridge/microwave, large computer/office desk and a huge bathroom with humongous shower I'd die for to have at home. Also at first glance you'd think there'd be a lot of live in traffic with rude residents along with the other illegal activities that usually come with that type of set up. BUT again to our surprise it was a very peaceful and quiet night! Things that could use improvement would be where they have patched up holes in walls from former guest, I suppose, but not repainted, and perhaps the ceilings could use a little TLC but all and all the best bang for our buck we've received in a long time (habitual travelers)!! We were charged $54.99 +tax for a weekend rate!! Definitely will reconsider should we need a room for a future stay. Im giving 3 stars for overall appearance but definitely a 4 star for customer service and for a clean, quiet comfortable room with a very peaceful/pleasant stay!! Thank you...
I AM CHANGING MY RATE!!!!
Re-review since we had such a pleasant stay the first time we decided ti give it a try again. This time we asked for a non smoking room and were given a room that smelled like mildew and mold it wasnt a comfortable fit so we requested to be moved he explained that the rooms on that side where smoking although they clearly had the non smoking plack outside next to the door. We were then moved to room 117 at first glance we felt like it was going to be a comfortable night just like the 1st stay until I woke up to what felt like a bug biting me and red swollen inflamed bumps on my stomach and arms. This room has bed bugs!! Turned on lights and began to inspect further to notice the matress is very dirty, worn and outdated. I have never experienced this. We also awoke and immediately wanted to shower and found a  used dirty rag laying torward the back of an assumed clean towl. I suppose coming here is a gamble on what kind of room you get (good/bad) and they have tried to give the appearance of comfort within the rooms at first glance so thats the only reason they are getting two stars Nevertheless, we will definitely not be returning!!My initial post said never judge a book by its cover. Lesson here perhaps you should check the cover","wifi, pool"

This place is not what they say it is. The rooms have not been ""refurbished"", or if they have, it's a sorry excuse.
I was looking for a place to say for a couple months and this place kept coming up. A lot of the reviews said it was ""better"". From the second the taxi driver dropped me off i knew this was a mistake. He even said to me, ""be careful around here, it's a sketchy area."" When I went to check out the room the manager helped me with my bags, and commented on how heavy they were. ""Hope it's full of money."" Red flag!
Look at the URL of the website: extendedstaytucsonaz. Nothing about the company. This was deliberate for search engines to pick this up. This place is a trap and management knows it. The floor plans on the website are a lie. The rooms don't even have microwaves.
This place is located in the bad part of town (which they won't tell you) and this place apparently used to be associated with a drug rehabilitation center (where reforms get the first place to stay). Some areas of the place smell of drugs, some of the people are sketchy.

My first stay there was a comped weekend for potential business guests. We stayed in a junior suite and my wife and I were both impressed by its size and the decor.

Our board of directors took a tour a few months later and decided to use the facility. Our first Festival there was a big success and we have since signed a contract to use them through 2016. Most everyone commented favorably on the facility and staff. The restaurant was shorthanded on the Friday evening of our event but I think that was because they didn't know how many people to expect more than anything else.

I heard no complaints about the cleanliness of the place or it being in disrepair. The problems we did have during our Festival were minor and the staff has already made notes on how to do things differently for the next one.

We had used the Truman Hotel in Jefferson City for years to host our event and this place was a big step up from that.","restaurant, pool, massage, spa"

Upon arriving in Saginaw they told him no arrangements had been made for him and was offered a sleeping bag to sleep on the floor. He doesn't drive so thankfully I transported him, didn'tdrop him off and leave. Motel 6 was the closest motel to the facility he is assigned to. Upon arriving and asking for a room we were allowed to look at rooms and was offered a room with a microwave and fridge. Since he has to stay 3 days and 2 nights this is a plus. We were treated kindly and the desk clerk was very friendly. The room was decent for a ""cheap"" motel. We had clean linen and towels. To be safe I wiped everything with disinfectant wipes and spray.

The Independent was the cheapest I could find for it's location, so I booked it via my credit card points.

Pros:
-Breakfast in bed. You fill out the card they give you and just make sure you hang the tag on the door by 10 pm of the previous night. There isn't much to choose from (bagel vs. muffin), with a yogurt and orange juice - but it's still a pretty nice perk to have.
-Lots of restaurants nearby
-Nice front desk lady: shout out to Sydney who gave us a later checkout at 11:30, as opposed to 11.
-Microwave and fridge in the room
-Room are spacious

Cons:
-Shower is weird and dark. maybe slightly moldy so that's probably why they keep it dark.
-The hotel is kind of hard to find if you're driving, since there's a lot of construction nearby
-Stains on towels
-Toilet was not clean
-AC vent blows on your head when you are sleeping
-Pillows are too high so it hurts your neck

Parking is $25 in a nearby lot. You'll have to check in first to get a ticket to bring to the lot. Overall, the cons outweigh the pros. Cleanliness is the most important factor for me when I'm looking for a hotel, so I probably would not stay here again the next time I'm in town.","restaurant, parking, spa"

The parking lot is made of big stones which makes it very bumpy. You just have to be careful getting in and out especially if your driving a mustang or compact car.
The building and property are nice and quiet. However we did have a lot of bugs in our room. By the end of the week we had small reddish coloured ants all over out headboard. We did not keep any food out, everything stayed in the fridge. The ants just came right through the screens.
There is no ac and it does get quite warm in the rooms.
Using the electronic codes to get in the building and room worked very well. However, they told us if we had any problems or questions to text them. We texted them regarding the bugs and to ask the check out time and we never received any answers back.
Also, since there is no staff at the building towels and bedding are not changed regularly. I don't need new towels everyday but maybe every 3 days would be nice. When its hot and muggy and your hiking, or swimming in the ocean daily, you tend to have more showers and refreshing the towels at least once would have been nice. (we stayed 6 days)

I recommend sorting your camping gear into easy to carry bags. It is difficult carrying large heavy items, like totes or coolers, to the campsites.

As far as the room itself, the price was a little high for the quality, and the bnb remote didn't work that well, but otherwise it wasn't a bad place.

I would say if you don't mind rude people, then it's not a bad lodging spot. If you don't want to deal with unnecessary attitude at 1am then I'd find somewhere else.",laundry

One visit to Ocean Ridge Plantation and you will know why.   This is a lovely community with 4 world renowned golf courses, tons of amenities and residents who take great price in their community.

This here is a picture on August 31 2020 of the moon over the Lion Paws golf course in Ocean Ridge.   It is not unusual to find residents out walking in the early evening around the community and taking in the beautiful night sky and cooler temperatures in the evening (cooler as in the low 80s or upper 70s).

There is plenty more information available about Ocean Ridge on the Ocean ridge website homesforsaleoceanridge.com

There is no elevator and the hallways temperatures are the same as if you were standing outside. No air conditioning.

The refrigerator/freezer had to be replaced because the freezer door was off and moldy. NO racks on door to place drinks. The new one we got still you couldn't close the freezer door. There was a missing light bulb in.one.of the light fixtures.. The bathroom sink had a slow drain.The toilet seat needed to be tighten very loose moved . There were two very small towels in a room meant for 4 people. The towels very rough to the touch. The TV remote control in the room didn't  work the whole 2 night stay. Tried to use the phone in the room to call the front desk but it did not work was plugged in but no service. Had to go to the front desk to  complain or ask a question.The parking area is very tight and was told upon checking in that there is one spot for every room. When we came back that night we had no spot and then was told by the night clerk thay they can't guarantee a spot and it is on a first come first serve basis. Totally unacceptable!! After he got the manager on the phone he gave us a parking permit to park on the STREET. We went to make coffee in our room the next morning to find that the coffee maker had a used filter and grounds in it from a previous guest.Yuck!
The Continental breakfast was okay. However I had to ask that for the table to be cleaned because there wasn't a clean table. They have one waffle maker and each waffle takes  2.35 minutes to cook. I was making 4  for my family so A line started forming behind me. Some guests were not patient. Other options were toast,cereal and yogurt. I saw a woman holding down the lever on the toaster to make her toast because it wouldn't  stay down.
Ask for a blow dryer not in room, which they gave me but it was old and dirty. The maid service was basically they make the beds maybe sweep the floor. Found trash under the bathroom vanity when I drop a cap from my hair product and went to pick it up was not from us. I actually found a note on the tip envelope from a previous visitor that rented the room that said room never cleaned  and wrote zero on it as the tip,showed it to the manager and it didn't even phase her. I asked for a reduce rate based on everything that happened during the stay and she wouldn't do it. Paid $500 for 2 nights. Not worth it.Would Never Stay here again!

I'll start with those. They stayed for a week, and for three of those days, one of their rooms had no sheets. Was brought to Management's attention, nothing was done. Multiple rooms had no soap or shampoo for the shower. When they asked someone to clean their room and replace their towels, the staff instead gathered the towels, put them inside the bathtub, and left. No change of sheets or anything else. Another girl left a gallon or more of huckleberries in her room by mistake, and they somehow ""disappeared"" by the time she called to inquire about them later that day. I have no doubt they were stolen for use in the restaurant or consumed by their horrendous staff.

Now for the restaurant, which I experienced myself. I went as a part of about 12, not small, but the dozen other patrons in the restaurant left shortly after we arrived. We managed to completely overwhelm the kitchen staff, which we were told was the chef and his trainee/dishwasher. I ordered a 16 ounce steak dinner, which cost $26. I ordered it rare, received it medium, about 75 minutes later. That's not an exaggeration, it was three hours before everyone got done eating because the food came out so intermittently. Another ordered his medium rare, received it well done. All of our meals included salads, only one person received one, and that was her entree. It took 90 minutes before that arrived. When the bartender began to get our checks out, because I was angry with everything there and ready to leave, I had to wait for another 30 minutes before she was able to get them to us.

Apparently this place used to be good. The food is overpriced, poorly made, and the entire resort is understaffed and mismanaged. There is absolutely no reason to come here. If you want to eat a meal with a view, go to Hills Resort. Both the bar and the restaurant have good food, and you can see the lake just as well. Do not waste your time, and especially not your money, at this garbage excuse for a resort. They have not earned the privilege.","restaurant, resort, food"

Despite my repeated requests (3 times to be exact), Venus not only refused to provide any form of logistical assistance, but also gradually raised her voice and unreasonably demanded that I should move the boxes myself.

I hope no one else would receive such an unpleasant experience and treatment.","restaurant, pool"

Close your eyes and picture some Frank Sinatra music playing as you sit poolside in the Italian countryside. Imagine a beautiful blue sky day with birds chirping and everyone around you smiles. This isn’t a dream, it’s your afternoon enjoying lunch by the pool after a quality massage at SeaHill Spa.

While the facilities offered besides the pool are lacking, you could easily spend a full day at the Hotel/Spa thanks to the beautiful pool. Either way, it’s easy to slip into a relaxed state. You can enjoy the Himalayan salt room, zero-gravity spa chair, sauna, steam room, or beautiful infinity pool alone or with a loved one. If you visit first thing on a weekend or in the afternoon on a weekday you pretty much have the place to yourself.","pool, massage, resort, parking, spa"
